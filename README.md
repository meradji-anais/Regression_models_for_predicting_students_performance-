# Regression models for predicting students performance

This project addresses the high failure rates in Portuguese secondary education by predicting student performance in Portuguese language through:

-Linear Regression

-Polynomial Regression

-Normal Equation

-Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

By analyzing student demographic, social, and academic data, etc.. the study provides accurate predictions and valuable insights to identify at-risk students and support early interventions.
